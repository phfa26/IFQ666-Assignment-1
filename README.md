## Application Architecture

The application is structured in a modular way to separate concerns and enhance maintainability:

- **`src/components`**: Reusable components, such as `Page`, `ListSection`, and `IntroSection`, which are shared across different pages.
- **`src/pages`**: Each main section of the site (Home, About, Resume, Portfolio) is organized within individual components here.
- **`src/styles`**: Contains theme definitions and shared styles.
- **`src/assets`**: Static files and images used across the application.

Each component is designed to be reusable, with custom styling applied through styled-components and Material-UIâ€™s theming capabilities.
